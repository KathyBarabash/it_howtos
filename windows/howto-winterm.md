## Install
Install from the Microsoft Store
> __TODO__ Update?

## Customize

Settings can be edited directly from WT; it is also possible to open ```settings.json```. For this, the system must have an editor (e.g. VScode). Working with the file is more flexible but requires knowing what settings are available and what values are afforded.

The ```settings.json``` for WT is located in 
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState
```
and edited by the system, e.g. when new wsl intances appear.

```

### Profiles
Each profile must have a guid. To generate guid
```
\\ Windows powershell
  [guid]::NewGuid()
  
\\ Linux
  uuidgen
```

To create a profile with elevated capabilities, use `gsudo`
```
\\ install gsudo on Windows
winget install gsudo

\\ add the profile with gsudo in command line
{
    "guid": "{62c54bbd-c2c6-5271-96e7-009a87ff44bf}",
    "name": "PowerShell âš¡",
    "commandline": "gsudo powershell.exe",
    "icon" : "ms-appx:///ProfileIcons/{61c54bbd-c2c6-5271-96e7-009a87ff44bf}.png",
    "fontFace":  "Delugia Nerd Font",
    "hidden": false,
}
```

### Startup Panes
I did not go there.
