Created by NetFoundry(born in Tata Communications’ Shape the Future innovation program, Barcelona) in 2017 by Galeal Zino, emerged from stealth in February 2017, with a diverse set of partners including Velocloud (later aquired by VMWare) and Integron (managed industrial IoT services for verticals such as healthcare and pharmaceutical, https://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/02/prweb14101106.htm).
- Feb at MWC2017 featuring IoT cameras use case with Dell EMC, V5 Systems, Wireless Glue, and Esprida.
- March at IBM Interconnect  				 https://netfoundry.io/ibm-interconnect-blending-multicloud-environments-software-everywhere/
https://netfoundry.io/introducing-the-netfoundry-appwan-for-watson/
- Apr 2017 joined EdgeX Foundry project by LinuxFoundation (https://www.edgexfoundry.org/)
- Joined Dell’s IoT Solutions Partner Program
- May 2017 joined the Industrial Internet Consortium (https://www.iiconsortium.org/). Now exited but here's an interesting coverage of connectivity reqs: https://www.iiconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/IIoT-Connectivity-Framework-2022-06-08.pdf
- Oct 2017 IoT Solutions World Congress (demo a solution with external id provider  https://netfoundry.io/neustar-netfoundry-deliver-worlds-first-identity-secured-iot-solution/)
- cleverDome partnership in FinTech (https://netfoundry.io/fintech-security-under-the-hood-with-netfoundry-dispersive-technologies/)
- Nov 2017 Entered AWS marketplace with NetFoundry MultiCloud Virtual Gateways https://netfoundry.io/netfoundry-multicloud-virtual-gateways-now-available-in-the-aws-marketplace/ NetFoundry’s AppWANs are the next logical step of SD-WAN, enabling secure, performant networking to be directly driven by application contexts, and extending the wide area network (WAN) all the way to the application endpoint without CPE or private network requirements. We integrated NetFoundry’s AppWANs into the networking solutions we sell to financial institutions to enable them to meet their strict regulatory and security requirements. Still there but remove for new customers https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-yxgjuh4sbxtle?qid=1511214783097


NetFoundry networks transform application environments to interconnectivity through application-specific networking (ASN) and provide an agile alternative to MPLS, Internet VPNs, and the public Internet, replacing the dependency on private circuits, proprietary hardware, and traditional telco solutions with optimized and secure sw solution. 
NetFoundry manages all the underlying infrastructure as a managed SaaS.
Each NetFoundry Network includes a cloud-based controller connected to the NetFoundry Console that enables infinite customization and scalability and offers solutions for typical cases such as multicloud connect (private, public and hybrid), IoT connect, integrated AppWANs, and branch office connections. Each network can be standalone, or can be bolted on to existing WANs or SD-WANs.
The connectivity is built right into applications with NF SDKs, or available as thin clients (through partnerships) for IoT devices and laptops, virtualized gateways for sites and cloud-native gateways available in the AWS and Azure Marketplaces. The connectivity is controlled via the NetFoundry Web Console or via the NetFoundry APIs (can be integrated into DevOps tools such as Ansible, Jenkins, CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager and Terraform).

SD-WANs and similar technologies have introduced some abstraction into site-to-site connectivity, but are often location, hardware, and service-provider specific. The modularity that makes the cloud and microservices so attractive requires a paradigm shift, where network edges are no longer defined by physical locations, but by application endpoints. Enter NetFoundry and application-specific networking (ASN).

Looks like at some point (Oct 2017) NF has introduced NF 'core' (https://netfoundry.io/managing-hybrid-multicloud-our-abstraction-is-your-salvation/)
NetFoundry enables enterprises to move applications to the cloud which they previously could not move due to insufficient security or inadequate internet performance.
- Adaptively and automatically route traffic across the best performing paths
- Proxying TCP, substituting a performant method over UDP, increases throughput by 3x to 7x compared to VPN and decreases latency
- Aggregate multiple networks into one according to policies, improving performance
